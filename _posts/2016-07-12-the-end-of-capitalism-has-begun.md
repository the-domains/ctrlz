  The red flags and marching songs of Syriza during the Greek crisis, plus the
  expectation that the banks would be nationalised, revived briefly a
  20th-century dream: the forced destruction of the market from above. For much
  of the 20th century this was how the left conceived the first stage of an
  economy beyond capitalism.
