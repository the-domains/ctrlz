            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Faroe Islands entices Google Street View via sheep-cams</h1><p>Human beings are gifted with ingenuity. It's what has allowed us to bolt 360-degree cameras to the roofs of cars to bring internet users virtual tours of anywhere. Well, almost anywhere.

For much of the 20th century this was how the left conceived the first stage of an economy beyond capitalism.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cd36c78cff456c08e3218af552fdb9e5/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fstatic%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F16%2F1437064824576%2Ff3ba5014-9489-4812-ab90-576a69c35bec-2060x1236.jpeg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3D31079f3d415033eea482896c75685863"></article>]]></description>
